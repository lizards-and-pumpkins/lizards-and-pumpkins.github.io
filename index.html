            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>Lizards &amp; Pumpkins is built by professionals working in e-commerce. Being unsatisfied with<br/>
                existing software we came down with our own online catalog implementation addressing the problems of<br />
                other solutions at the market, namely performance, scalability and catalog inconsistencies.</p>
            <h4>Consistent catalog</h4>
            <p>Because it utilizes NO caching or indexing!</p>
            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>Through server response time measuring only milliseconds.</p>
            <h4>Cost-effective scalability</h4>
            <p>
                Most e-commerce platforms are expensive to scale due to diminishing returns.<br/>
                With Lizards &amp; Pumpkins, a single, simple server is already able to handle a large
                amount of visitors.<br/>
                And adding a server will always scale up the same amount as the previous one.

            <h2>Immediate catalog updates</h2>
            <p>Lizards &amp; Pumpkins makes individual product changes (almost) instantaneous
                and bulk imports can be scaled up as needed depending on the catalog size.
                All the while pages still are being delivered at a blazing speed.</p>
            <h2>Calculable scalability</h2>
            <p>Due to Lizards &amp; Pumpkins linear scalability it is easy to work out how much
                power the servers need to be assigned to handle a given number of expected visitors.</p>
            <p>No more overpowered hardware idling around, no more traffic spikes slowing response times.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the platform makes good use of the hardware, which means smaller servers can serve more
                customers.</p>
            <h2>Integrate any third party system</h2>
            <p>Lizards &amp; Pumpkins supplies no PIM or CRM or other backoffice capabilities.
                Instead of building these into the product, our goal is to make integrating third party systems as 
                simple as possible.</p>
            <p>We follow the philosophy that a tool should do one thing well, rather than doing many things badly.</p>

            <h2>Clean Code</h2>
            <p>All developers working on Lizards &amp; Pumpkins have read (and agreed with) the principles of clean code,
                as presented by Robert C. (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) Martin in his classic book <a
                        href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code">"Clean Code"</a>.</p>
            <p>Every line of code is open-source. Every line of code is test driven. Every line of code has been
                reviewed before it was merged into the product.</p>
            <p>A flexible technology stack and no dependencies on 3rd party frameworks help keep technical dept in
                check and make Lizards &amp; Pumpkins easy to adjust to a merchants unique requirements.</p>
            <h2>Developer VM</h2>
            <p>A vagrant based developer VM is <a href="https://github.com/lizards-and-pumpkins/dev-vm">available on
                github</a>.
                It contains a pre-configured environment of Lizards &amp; Pumpkins ready for you to start exploring.
                All non-catalog features (for example the shopping basket and checkout) are provided by a Magento (1.x)
                CE installation with sample data.</p>
            <h2>API first</h2>
            <p>Lizards &amp; Pumpkins doesn't care if the catalog is delivered as HTML or as JSON (or XML or anything else).
                This can be utilized to build an API first or API only catalog. This allows the shop frontend to be
                developed as an independent application, decoupled from the server-side application.</p>
            <p>However, it is also possible to render the complete catalog server side as a website that does not
                require JavaScript.</p>
            <h2>Made for custom applications</h2>
            <p>Lizards &amp; Pumpkins provides a basic pre-rendering and content delivery platform, on which any given store
                can be implemented.
                Our goal is not to provide a turn-key ready solution, but rather a strong foundation for custom built
                commerce applications.
                Lizards &amp; Pumpkins handles the preparation and delivery of the content.</p>
