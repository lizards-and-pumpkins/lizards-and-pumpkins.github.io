            <p>Lizards & Pumpkins is built by professionals working in e-commerce. Being unsatisfied with<br/>
                existing software we came down with our own online catalog implementation. <br />
                Addressing the problems of other solutions at the market, namely performance and catalog inconsistencies.</p>

            <h2>Catalog Without Trade-offs</h2>
            <p>Merchants have to make a hard decision between performance and consistency. The online shop
                catalog can be either fast or contain up to date stocks, prices and other product data.</p>
            <p>Lizards & Pumpkins resolves this trade-off: It makes all product changes instant and delivers pages
                at a blazing speed.</p>
